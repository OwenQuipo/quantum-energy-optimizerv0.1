# Quantum Battery Dispatch (v0.1)

This repository contains a **quantum-native optimization engine** for battery
charge / discharge scheduling.

The core decision problem is formulated as a **QUBO (Quadratic Unconstrained
Binary Optimization)** and solved using **QAOA** via Qiskit, with a classical
brute-force solver used for verification on small instances.

## What this does
Given:
- hourly electricity prices
- a battery with limited energy and power
- an initial state of charge

The system computes an **optimal dispatch schedule**:
- CHARGE
- DISCHARGE
- IDLE

The quantum solver directly participates in selecting the schedule.

## Why quantum?
Battery dispatch decisions are:
- discrete
- globally coupled in time
- constraint-heavy

This makes them a natural fit for quantum optimization methods, rather than
continuous relaxations or heuristic rules.
